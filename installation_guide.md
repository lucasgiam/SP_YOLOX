## 0. Prerequisities

You should have the following installed on your workstation:
* Anaconda
* NVIDIA CUDA toolkit and cuDNN driver


## 1. Installation

* Launch the terminal window, create a virtual environment and activate it.

```
conda create -n YOLOX
conda activate YOLOX
```

* Install all the required packages below:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -v -e .
pip install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI
pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -U peekingduck
```


## 2. Load your own custom dataset

* This section assumes that you have already collected your image data and annnotated the images to the Pascal VOC format.

* Open ```YOLOX/datasets``` folder and create the following directory. Note that <dataset_name> is the name of the dataset, for example ```sp_ppe_voc_all_combinations```.

📁 YOLOX/
📄 ├── datasets/
📄 │   ├── VOCdevkit/
📄 │   │   ├── VOC2012/
📄 │   │   │   ├── <dataset_name>/
📄 │   │   │   │   ├── Annotations/
📄 │   │   │   │   ├── ImageSets/
📄 |   |   |   |   |   ├── Main/
📄 |   |   |   |   |   |   ├── train.txt
📄 |   |   |   |   |   |   ├── val.txt
📄 |   |   |   |   |   |   ├── test.txt
📄 │   │   │   │   ├── JPEGImages/

* Transfer all the images (.jpg) into the ```JPEGImages``` folder and all the annotations (.xml) into the ```Annotations``` folder.

* Go into ```train_val_test_split.py``` in the root directory and configure the root_path, seed, train_percent and val_percent, and then run the script using the command:

```python train_val_test_split.py```

* Next, go to ```./yolox/data/datasets```, open the two files ```coco_classes.py``` and ```voc_classes.py```, and set the class labels accordingly.

* See example below for ```sp_ppe_1``` dataset:

VOC_CLASSES = (
    "no_ppe",
    "all_ppe",
    "helmet",
    "mask",
    "vest",
    "mask_vest",
    "helmet_mask",
    "helmet_vest",
)


## 3. Download pre-trained weights

* In the root directory, enter the following command to download pre-trained weights into the ```weights``` folder. Note that you can change ```yolo_s``` to ```yolo_m``` or ```yolo_l```, depending on the size of the model that you want.

``` wget.exe -P weights/pretrained https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/storage/releases/download/0.0.1/yolox_s.pth ```

(Note: If you do not already have ```wget.exe``` installed on your computer, you can refer to this video on how to do so: https://youtu.be/CkpTEJH6xkg)


## 4. Train the model

* Create your own ```exp``` file in the "./exps/custom" folder and configure all the necessary training parameters in this ```exp``` file. You can reference the code of the ```exp``` file from ```./exps/custom/sp_ppe_1.py``` or ```./exps/example/yolox_voc/yolox_voc_s.py```.

* Run the following command to initiate model training:

```
python tools/train.py -expn <exp_name> -f <path_to_exp_file> -d <num_gpus> --dist-backend <gloo_if_using_>1_gpu, otherwise_omit_this_parser> -b <batch_size> --fp16 -o -c <path_to_pretrained_weights>
```

* For example:

```
python tools/train.py -expn sp_ppe_test -f .\exps\custom\sp_ppe.py -d 2 --dist-backend gloo -b 16 --fp16 -o -c .\weights\pretrained\yolox_s.pth
```

* Once training is completed, go to the output directory where the weights are saved to and copy the ```best_ckpt.pth``` file to the ```weights``` folder, under a <exp_name> subfolder.


## 5. Package the model into PeekingDuck custom node

* Refer to https://peekingduck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/03_custom_nodes.html on how to create PeekingDuck custom nodes (if you are not already familiar with it).

* To package the model into PeekingDuck custom node, we will need to create and configure two files, ```<exp_name>.py``` (source code) and ```<exp_name>.yaml``` (config file), in the standard directory format as mentioned in the PeekingDuck custom node tutorial. You can reference the code of these two files from ```./src/custom_nodes/model/sp_ppe_1_yolo_m.py``` (source code) and ```./src/custom_nodes/configs/model/sp_ppe_1_yolo_m.yml``` (config file).


## 6. Run the model

* Open the ```pipeline_config.yml``` file in the YOLOX root directory and put in order all the necessary nodes to form a pipeline. This includes specifying the input source, custom nodes for model inference and bboxes post-processing, as well as the output directory of media and csv logs.

* In the terminal window, enter the following command:

```peekingduck run```

* In order to view the 10-second video clip in the mobile app, you will first need to set up the web server on this computer and ensure that both the mobile phone and this computer are connected to the same network. To set up the web server, open a separate terminal window, cd to the project root directory and enter the following command:

```python -m http.server```
